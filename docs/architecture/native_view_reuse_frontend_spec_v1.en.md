# Native-View-Reuse Driven Frontend Page Design Spec v1

## 1. Objective

This spec standardizes how frontend pages are built in this repo:

`Odoo native views define base structure -> backend normalizes and lifts semantics -> frontend renders from unified contracts -> scene/product layer adds enhancements.`

Scope:
- Odoo backend view parsing
- frontend generic renderers
- scene orchestration
- product enhancement layer

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Native structure first**: if native view already defines field/group/notebook/header/chatter/x2many/modifiers, frontend must not redefine it.
2. **Backend interpretation first**: frontend must not parse XML or infer business semantics.
3. **Generic renderer first**: prioritize shared renderers over page-level hardcoding.
4. **Enhancement as extension**: risk/AI/next-action panels must be injected as extension blocks, not by mutating base renderers.
5. **Consistency first**: Odoo backend and custom frontend must keep consistent semantics, permission outcomes, and status meaning.

## 3. Four-Layer Page Model

1) **Native View Layer**: raw Odoo view facts.
2) **Normalized Structure Layer**: standardized machine-consumable structure.
3) **Semantic Page Layer**: `zone + block` semantics for rendering.
4) **Product Orchestration Layer**: scene/role-specific composition without breaking base semantics.

Recommended zones:
- `header_zone`, `summary_zone`, `detail_zone`, `relation_zone`
- `action_zone`, `collaboration_zone`, `insight_zone`, `attachment_zone`

Recommended blocks:
- `title_block`, `status_block`, `action_bar_block`, `field_group_block`
- `notebook_block`, `relation_table_block`, `stat_button_block`
- `chatter_block`, `attachment_block`, `risk_alert_block`
- `ai_recommendation_block`, `next_action_block`

## 4. Mandatory Delivery Flow

1. Check native view carrying capability first.
2. If UI is insufficient, improve backend semantic output first.
3. Frontend consumes only semantic contracts (`page/zones/blocks/fields/actions/permissions`).
4. Page-level special cases are allowed only for high-value scenarios with explicit rationale.

## 5. Backend Responsibilities

Backend must output:
- base view definition
- structured page contract
- field modifiers
- executable actions
- permission/status interpretation with reason codes

Backend must not:
- dump raw XML and delegate semantic interpretation to frontend
- return only fields + records while omitting structure
- maintain multiple conflicting structure sources for one page

## 6. Frontend Responsibilities

Frontend is responsible for:
- structural rendering
- component mapping
- interaction and feedback
- form input management
- submit/refresh lifecycle
- extension slot rendering

Frontend must not:
- parse Odoo XML
- infer permissions/action availability
- rebuild business partitioning by guesswork
- override native semantic order with ad-hoc field order

## 7. Governance

### New page checklist
1. Is native view sufficient for base layout?
2. Is backend semantic output complete?
3. Is this requirement generic rendering or product enhancement?
4. Is a page special-case truly necessary?
5. Will this break renderer consistency?

### Implementation priority
1. Backend parsing/normalization
2. Frontend generic renderers
3. Semantic orchestration
4. Product enhancement
5. Page special-cases

## 8. Enforced Rule for Future Iterations

From this spec onward:
- New page work must start with native-carrying assessment.
- Structure gaps must be fixed in backend semantic output first.
- Frontend page structure must be contract-driven.
- Any page special-case must include entry criteria and exit criteria in iteration notes.

## 9. One-Line Policy

Native Odoo views define the base page structure, backend provides unified semantics, frontend renders generically, and high-value scenes receive product enhancements.


## Effective runtime structure (2026-09-16)

Native views provide the complete default baseline, not the exclusive layout authoring source. The backend composes authorized industry defaults, customer preferences and administrator configuration, validates business and security constraints, and emits one effective tree shared by content, navigation and preview. Restrictions on rewriting native structure prohibit client-side reinterpretation and duplicate defaults, not legitimate low-code layout configuration. See `native_first_form_structure_authority_v1.md` for identity, conflict and lifecycle rules.
