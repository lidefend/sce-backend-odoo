# Delivery Readiness Execution Evidence (2026-03-19)

## 1. Context

- Branch: `codex/delivery-sprint-seal-gaps`
- Goal: verify that the delivery-readiness chain (role matrix + runtime boundary) passes in a system-bound run
- Execution date: 2026-03-19

---

## 2. Commands Executed

```bash
make verify.scene.delivery.readiness.role_matrix
make verify.portal.role_surface_smoke.container
```

---

## 3. Outcome

- Result: `PASS`
- Key findings:
  - all role-matrix snapshot guards passed
  - scene runtime boundary gate passed
  - scene delivery readiness passed
  - role-surface smoke passed (owner/pm/finance/executive)

### 3.1 Role Surface Smoke Summary

| `demo_role_pm` | pm | `portal.dashboard` | `/s/portal.dashboard` | 1 |
| `demo_role_finance` | finance | `finance.payment_requests` | `/s/finance.payment_requests` | 1 |

## 5. Relevance to Sprint Goal

This run directly supports the sprint by:

1. moving delivery-readiness from document-only assessment to system-bound evidence
2. providing a stable base for the 9-module acceptance matrix (runtime boundary + role matrix + role smoke are green)
3. enabling the next role-journey smoke stage (PM / Finance / Procurement / Executive)

---

## 6. Recommended Next Steps

1. continue with role-journey smoke evidence per module mapping
2. link this file with `delivery_readiness_scoreboard_v1.en.md` for dual entry (status + evidence)
3. include the key output paths above in PR acceptance notes

## 7. Payment Approval Smoke Field Compatibility

To prevent downstream misinterpretation, this sprint aligns the summary field naming in `payment_request_approval_smoke` (N+2 sunset completed):

- New field: `live_no_executable_actions`
  - Meaning: no executable action for the current actor in live mode (`allowed && actor_matches_required_role`)

`live_no_allowed_actions` has been removed in N+2 and is no longer emitted.

All downstream scripts/reports should migrate to `live_no_executable_actions` as the primary key.
