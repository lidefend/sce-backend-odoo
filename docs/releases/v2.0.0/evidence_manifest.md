# v2.0.0 Evidence Manifest

This manifest supersedes the planned `v1.0.0` release line because the remote
`v1.0.0` tag already exists and tag names must not be reused.

## Evidence Rules

- Evidence from `sc_prod_sim` must not be presented as `sc_prod` evidence.
- Production deployment evidence is recorded separately after supervised
  deployment begins.
- If production deployment includes migrated or legacy attachments, production
  evidence must include `make history.attachment.custody.probe.prod`.
- If the attachment custody probe reports a marker gap, snapshot affected
  `ir_attachment` rows before `make legacy_attachment.custody_marker.backfill.prod`.
- Snapshot changes must include the command that produced them.
- Failed evidence is not overwritten without preserving the failure reason in an
  iteration record.

## Current Local Verification Status

- Command: `make verify.release.v2_0_0.product_hardening`
- Status: PASS in the current local `sc_demo` dev verification environment
  after uninstalling `smart_construction_demo` and clearing the remaining
  `smart_construction_demo` XMLID rows that Odoo could not remove because
  audit-log foreign keys still reference retained users.
- Demo-data release gate:
  `DB_NAME=sc_demo make verify.product.no_demo_data` PASS.
- Demo-data closure facts on `sc_demo`:
  `smart_construction_demo` module state is `uninstalled`,
  `smart_construction_demo` XMLID count is `0`, and
  `verify.product.no_demo_data` reports PASS.
- Previous blocker preserved:
  before local cleanup, `verify.product.no_demo_data` failed because
  `smart_construction_demo` was installed, `res.partner` had 3 active
  demo-name records, and `smart_construction_demo` XMLID count was 112.
- Latest passing sub-gate in this batch:
  `make verify.product.sla.baseline`.
- Closed hardening target:
  `make verify.release.v2_0_0.product_hardening` PASS.
- Release hardening also includes
  `verify.frontend.widget_richness.post_ga.guard` for x2many, subviews,
  kanban/view-type semantics, and v2 chatter/attachments projection, plus
  `verify.lowcode_config.customer_module_asset.pipeline` for customer low-code
  asset candidate, draft, decision template, dry-run apply, safety tests, and
  replay guard, and
  `verify.lowcode_config.customer_module_asset.release_hardening.guard` to keep
  the customer asset pipeline wired into formal product release readiness.
- Artifacts:
  - `artifacts/backend/bundle_installation_report.json`
  - `artifacts/backend/platform_performance_smoke.json`
  - `artifacts/backend/non_demo_data_contamination_guard.json`
- Evidence shape guards:
  - `make verify.product.no_demo_data.schema.guard`
  - `make verify.bundle.installation.ready.schema.guard`
  - `make verify.platform.performance.smoke.schema.guard`
- Schema-only guard runs may use recorded artifact directories to verify evidence
  shape, but recorded sample artifacts are not release signoff evidence.
- Recorded prod-sim schema evidence path:
  `artifacts/migration/fresh_replay_validity_20260508T1720`, verified with
  `PROD_SIM_ACCEPTANCE_ARTIFACT_DIR=artifacts/migration/fresh_replay_validity_20260508T1720 make verify.release.v2_0_0.formal_evidence.schema.guard`.
- Note: before creating `gate-release-v2.0` or `v2.0.0-rc1`, rerun required
  gates on a clean reviewed release database and attach the fresh artifacts.
- Note: before creating final `v2.0.0`, rerun
  `PROD_SIM_ACCEPTANCE_ARTIFACT_DIR=<run_dir> make verify.release.v2_0_0.formal_evidence.schema.guard`
  against the recorded prod-sim acceptance run directory for that release
  candidate.
