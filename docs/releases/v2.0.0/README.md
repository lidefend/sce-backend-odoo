# v2.0.0 Release Control

## Status

- Version: `v2.0.0`
- Status: planned
- Release type: formal release
- Planned gate tag: `gate-release-v2.0`
- Planned RC tag: `v2.0.0-rc1`
- Planned final tag: `v2.0.0`
- Governance date: 2026-05-12

## Layer Target / Module / Reason

- Layer Target: Ops / Release Governance
- Module: versioning, release index, release checklist, release notes, release evidence manifest, verify catalog
- Reason: establish the active formal release line before RC and production
  deployment work begins, avoiding reuse of the existing remote `v1.0.0` tag.

## Release Boundaries

This release-control directory defines release governance only.

It does not:

- create Git tags
- deploy production
- reset or replace databases
- change public intent semantics
- change frontend runtime behavior

## Required Gates

```bash
make verify.release.v2_0_0.preflight
git diff --check
```

Supporting gates:

```bash
make verify.system.capability_baseline.report
make verify.platform.release_policy.runtime
make verify.backend.contract.closure.mainline
make verify.restricted
```

Formal-release hardening gate:

```bash
make verify.release.v2_0_0.product_hardening
```

## Release Documents

- Versioning: `docs/ops/versioning.md`
- Release index: `docs/releases/README.md`
- Release index (zh): `docs/releases/README.zh.md`
- Verify catalog: `docs/ops/verify/README.md`
- Release notes: `docs/ops/release_notes_v2.0.0.md`
- Release checklist: `docs/ops/release_checklist_v2.0.0.md`
- Evidence manifest: `docs/releases/v2.0.0/evidence_manifest.md`

## Promotion Order

1. Finish release governance on a feature branch.
2. Merge reviewed release governance and code changes to `main`.
3. Run release preflight on `main`.
4. Create `gate-release-v2.0` after gate evidence passes.
5. Close product hardening gate.
6. Run `make verify.release.v2_0_0.governance.guard`.
7. Run prod-sim acceptance.
8. Run `PROD_SIM_ACCEPTANCE_ARTIFACT_DIR=<run_dir> make verify.release.v2_0_0.formal_evidence.schema.guard`.
9. Create `v2.0.0-rc1` after RC evidence passes.
10. Create `v2.0.0` after formal release signoff.

Recorded sample artifact directories may validate schema shape only; final
release signoff requires the recorded prod-sim acceptance run directory for that
release candidate.

## Rollback

Release governance rollback is file-level:

- remove `docs/releases/v2.0.0/`
- remove `docs/ops/release_notes_v2.0.0.md`
- remove `docs/ops/release_checklist_v2.0.0.md`
- remove `verify.release.v2_0_0.preflight` from `Makefile`
- remove `verify.release.v2_0_0.product_hardening` from `Makefile`
- remove `verify.release.v2_0_0.governance.guard` from `Makefile`
- remove `verify.release.v2_0_0.formal_evidence.schema.guard` from `Makefile`
- restore `docs/ops/versioning.md` edits
- restore `docs/releases/README.md` edits
- restore `docs/releases/README.zh.md` edits
- restore `docs/ops/verify/README.md` edits

Runtime rollback is outside this governance batch and must follow the production
runbook if production deployment has started.
