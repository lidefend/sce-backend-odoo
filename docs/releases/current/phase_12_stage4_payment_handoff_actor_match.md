# Phase 12 Stage 4: Payment Handoff Actor Match Contract

## Scope

- Keep payment approval business behavior unchanged.
- Extend action-surface contract so frontend can guide handoff by current actor role.

## Backend Contract Additions

Intent: `payment.request.available_actions`

Per action item now includes:

- `actor_matches_required_role: boolean`
- `handoff_required: boolean`

Existing fields remain unchanged:

- `required_role_key`
- `required_role_label`
- `required_group_xmlid`
- `handoff_hint`
- `delivery_priority`

## Frontend Delivery

- `ModelFormPage` renders actor-role match hint in semantic action cards.
- When role mismatch exists, UI shows explicit handoff copy:
  - `请转交给 <角色> 处理`
- Action-surface evidence utilities in user form:
  - `复制动作面` copies structured JSON (actions + role hints + priority).
  - `导出动作面` downloads JSON for delivery evidence.
  - `导出历史` downloads filtered action history JSON.
  - `导出证据包` downloads one bundle (action surface + action history + last feedback/trace).
  - `复制执行包` / `导出执行包` near feedback trace for latest execution snapshot.
  - `复制最新Trace` in history panel for direct support handoff.
  - caution visual emphasis for high-risk actions (`approve` / `done`).
  - action stats now surface latest failure reason from recent execution history.
  - `导出可执行` exports current allowed action summary JSON.
  - `?` hotkey toggles shortcut help panel.
  - `复制阻塞文本` copies plain-text blocked reasons for chat/email handoff.
  - history reason filter is persisted per record in local storage.
  - `复制转交说明` (for handoff-required actions) copies a plain-text handoff note with role and trace.
    - includes current filter and blocked top reasons for context.
  - stale refresh hint highlights action surface older than 60 seconds.
  - stale banner blocks user attention and provides one-click refresh before execution.
  - stale execution guard: semantic action execution asks for confirmation when surface is stale; cancel triggers auto-refresh.
  - auto-refresh interval selector (15s/30s/60s) with local storage persistence.
  - blocked reason top summary is visible in action stats for quick diagnosis.
  - `复制统计` copies action-surface stats snapshot for support handoff.
  - action stats now show absolute `刷新时刻` timestamp.
  - semantic action search keyword is persisted per record.
  - `重置面板` clears local UI preferences (filter/search/auto-refresh) in one click.
  - action-surface readiness score (`就绪度`) gives quick execution confidence (with stale penalty).
  - top blocked action summary surfaces the first blocking candidates.
  - action stats now show top allowed actions for quick execution preview.
  - `导出阻塞` exports blocked action summary JSON for coordination.
  - `导出CSV` exports action history as CSV for offline review.
  - action stats show recent execution success rate.
  - `Alt+F` hotkey refreshes action surface quickly.
  - blocked reason chips support one-click reason filtering.
  - `复制可执行文本` copies allowed actions in plain text for chat handoff.
  - auto-refresh pauses when tab is hidden and exposes paused status in stats.
  - empty history now shows guidance copy before first action run.
  - key action tool buttons now include aria-label/title for accessibility.
  - history panel supports keyword search (action/reason/trace).
  - history panel supports success/failed outcome filter.
  - history filters are persisted per record (outcome + keyword).
  - history filter reset is available as one-click action.
  - action stats include quick-run button for current primary action.
  - `复制主动作说明` copies plain-text action briefing for handoff.
  - when no action is executable, banner guides user and can run first suggested action.
  - history retention size is configurable (6/10/20) and persisted.
  - `复制筛选摘要` copies current history filter context for issue reporting.

## Verification

- `make verify.frontend.typecheck.strict` ✅
- `make verify.frontend.build` ✅
- `make verify.portal.payment_request_approval_smoke.container DB_NAME=sc_demo` ✅
- `make verify.portal.payment_request_approval_handoff_smoke.container DB_NAME=sc_demo` ✅

## Release Review Baseline

- Sidebar menu scene coverage evidence (required for release review):
  - `docs/releases/current/menu_scene_coverage_evidence.md`

## Compatibility Field Sunset Plan

For `payment_request_approval_smoke.py` summary payload, use this transition policy:

- Preferred key: `live_no_executable_actions`
- Compatibility key: `live_no_allowed_actions` (removed in N+2)

Execution window (starting this sprint):

1. **Iteration N (current)**
   - Output both keys.
   - All downstream parsers switched to new-first fallback-old logic.
2. **Iteration N+1**
   - Keep both keys.
   - Confirm no consumer still depends on old-only key.
3. **Iteration N+2**
   - Remove `live_no_allowed_actions` from output.
   - ✅ Completed in this branch.

Current parser contract (post N+2):

- `bool(summary.get("live_no_executable_actions", False))`

Removal gate (all must pass):

- Approval smoke pipeline (`verify.portal.payment_request_approval_smoke.container`) stays green.
- Handoff smoke pipeline (`verify.portal.payment_request_approval_handoff_smoke.container`) stays green.
- Verify docs/readme and release evidence no longer reference old-only semantics.
