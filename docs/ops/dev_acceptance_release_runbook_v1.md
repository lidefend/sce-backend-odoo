# Dev Acceptance Release Runbook v1

## Scope

This runbook standardizes the dev acceptance release path for `sc_demo`.
It covers uploaded backup validation, running-service alignment, frontend static
publication, and a minimal real-user acceptance probe.

It does not automate destructive database restore. Restore remains an
operator-supervised step because it replaces the running acceptance database and
filestore.

## Layer Target / Module / Reason

- Layer Target: Ops / Release
- Module: dev acceptance release flow (`sc_demo`)
- Reason: make the upload-to-acceptance path repeatable and verifiable.

## Inputs

- Backup directory containing:
  - `SHA256SUMS`
  - `<db>_<timestamp>.dump`
  - `<db>_filestore_<timestamp>.tgz`
- Target DB: `sc_demo`
- Dev env file: `.env.dev`
- Public dev URL: `http://<host>:18081/` unless nginx is deliberately rebound.
- The daily development server's non-interactive shell startup files must be
  compatible with `set -u`. In particular, `/etc/bash.bashrc` and the release
  user's `~/.bashrc` must not read an unset `PS1`; use `${PS1:-}` in the
  non-interactive guard so release logs are not polluted by shell startup
  noise.

## Required Sequence

1. Validate the uploaded backup package:

   ```bash
   ACCEPTANCE_BACKUP_DIR=/tmp/20260512T125816 \
   ENV=dev ENV_FILE=.env.dev DB_NAME=sc_demo \
   make verify.dev.acceptance.release
   ```

2. If restore is required, perform it only after explicit operator approval.
   Use the container-native restore path and keep DB and filestore paired from
   the same uploaded package.

3. Rebuild the served frontend static bundle for the target DB:

   ```bash
   ENV=dev ENV_FILE=.env.dev DB_NAME=sc_demo \
   make verify.frontend.build
   ```

4. Run the publication acceptance probe:

   ```bash
   ACCEPTANCE_BACKUP_DIR=/tmp/20260512T125816 \
   ACCEPTANCE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18081 \
   ACCEPTANCE_LOGIN=wutao ACCEPTANCE_PASSWORD='<password>' \
   ENV=dev ENV_FILE=.env.dev DB_NAME=sc_demo \
   make release.dev.acceptance.publish
   ```

   On the daily development runtime server, use the stricter topology-locked
   entrypoint instead:

   ```bash
   ACCEPTANCE_BACKUP_DIR=/tmp/20260512T125816 \
   ACCEPTANCE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18081 \
   ACCEPTANCE_LOGIN=wutao ACCEPTANCE_PASSWORD='<password>' \
   ENV=dev ENV_FILE=.env.dev DB_NAME=sc_demo \
   make release.daily_dev.acceptance.publish
   ```

   This target first runs `env.matrix.check` and
   `verify.daily_dev.runtime_repo.clean`, so the acceptance publication cannot
   run from the wrong server directory or a dirty runtime repository.
   It also runs `verify.daily_dev.acceptance.env.guard`, which rejects anything
   other than `ENV=dev`, `ENV_FILE=.env.dev`, `DB_NAME=sc_demo`, and
   `ACCEPTANCE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18081`; it requires
   `ACCEPTANCE_LOGIN=wutao` and a non-empty `ACCEPTANCE_PASSWORD`, so the
   publish gate must exercise real login and `system.init`. The daily product
   navigation baseline requires `ACCEPTANCE_NAV_MIN_ACTIONS=100`,
   `ACCEPTANCE_NAV_MAX_ACTIONS=115`, and
   `ACCEPTANCE_NAV_FORBIDDEN_LABELS=用户核对菜单,用户数据验收,用户验收,直营项目系统菜单`.
   It also requires `ACCEPTANCE_NAV_REQUIRED_PATHS` to include the locked daily
   product path sample for customer, supplier, project ledger, general contract,
   construction diary, inbound, payment request, project capital overview,
   payroll, company archive, and input invoice entries.
   Action and menu ids must be discovered from the authenticated `system.init`
   result at runtime; `ACCEPTANCE_NAV_REQUIRED_ACTIONS` must remain empty so a
   database-specific numeric id cannot masquerade as product coverage.
   The evidence artifact must remain `artifacts/backend/dev_acceptance_release_probe.json`,
   the frontend output must remain `./frontend/apps/web/dist-dev`,
   `VITE_PLATFORM_ADMIN_DB` must remain `sc_platform_core`, and Vite build or
   runtime overrides must stay unset.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `SHA256SUMS` passes.
- `pg_restore -l` identifies the expected DB name.
- Filestore archive contains the expected DB directory prefix.
- `/` serves the latest `frontend/apps/web/dist/index.html`.
- The served `index-*.js` contains `sc_demo` and its default app env is `dev`.
  Historical or guard-list tokens such as `sc_prod_sim` may still exist in the
  bundle, but they must not be the default runtime target.
- `/api/v1/intent?db=sc_demo` returns `204` for `OPTIONS` and `405` for `GET`.
- Daily development publication must authenticate as `wutao` and run
  `system.init`; the resulting navigation must contain product action menus in
  the locked daily range, include the locked required path sample, point those
  paths to the locked runtime action ids, and must not expose old acceptance
  menu labels.
  Generic dev acceptance may still omit credentials only when it is not being
  used as a daily release gate.

## Evidence

The probe writes:

```text
artifacts/backend/dev_acceptance_release_probe.json
```

Keep this artifact with the release evidence. It records backup validation,
frontend publication checks, API checks, and optional login/system.init results.

## Rollback

- Frontend rollback: rebuild `frontend/apps/web/dist` using the previous
  intended `ENV`, `DB_NAME`, `VITE_APP_ENV`, and `VITE_ODOO_DB`.
- Database rollback: restore the prior database dump and matching filestore
  package as a pair.
- Proxy rollback: restore the previous nginx port/DB-lock configuration and
  verify `/api/` plus `/websocket` carry the intended DB lock headers.

## Stop Conditions

- Backup checksum fails.
- Dump DB name does not match the target DB.
- Filestore archive is missing or does not contain the target DB prefix.
- Served frontend bundle defaults to the wrong app env or runtime DB.
- `system.init` fails for the named acceptance user.
- Non-interactive SSH release commands emit shell-startup errors before the
  Makefile target begins.
