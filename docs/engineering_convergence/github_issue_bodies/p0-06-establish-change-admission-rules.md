### Problem and Goal

Main branch must reject uncontrolled changes.

### Scope

Apply PR template, issue templates, CODEOWNERS, branch protection, and required quality checks.

### Non-Scope

Team staffing changes.

### Acceptance Criteria

- `main` direct push is blocked.
- PR review is required.
- Required merge checks use `merge_policy_gate`; release qualification uses
  `release_candidate_gate` on explicit candidate heads.
- CODEOWNERS review is enforced.
