## Scope

This first P4-P0-03 slice starts decomposing `frontend/apps/web/src/pages/ContractFormPage.vue` without changing product behavior.

Extracted responsibilities:

- Save-record validation, save-value collection, create defaults, created-record navigation, and form navigation helper flows moved to focused `contractForm` modules.
- The Web Contract V2 frontend architecture guard is now part of the local `make ci` gate through `verify.unified_page_contract.v2.web_architecture`.
- High-risk split-plan file growth is now locked by `docs/engineering_convergence/complexity_baseline_lock.json` and `scripts/ci/enforce_complexity_baseline_lock.py`.
- Frontend page contract boundary, orchestration-consumption, and consumer-intrusion guards are now part of `make ci.local.quick`.
- This evidence document is checked by `scripts/ci/verify_contract_form_split_evidence.py` to keep line counts and remote-verification wording fresh.

The route component remains the orchestration shell and still owns runtime state, navigation, persistence, and user interaction flow.

## Line Count

| File | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `frontend/apps/web/src/pages/ContractFormPage.vue` | 13762 | 1778 |

## Boundary Decision

- Backend contracts remain the source of truth for fields, actions, permissions, and Odoo-native structure.
- The frontend extraction only names and consumes already-provided contract data.
- No frontend fallback menu, permission, action, or form policy was introduced.
- No data migration, backend endpoint change, or visual redesign is included in this slice.
- Existing `groups_xmlids` usage in `ContractFormPage.vue` is locked at 1 occurrence by `scripts/verify/web_contract_v2_frontend_architecture_guard.py`; the next cleanup must remove the final entitlement read fully behind backend contracts.
- `ContractFormPage.vue` is line-count locked at 1778 lines. Future work must continue extracting or modifying existing owned modules instead of adding new responsibilities to the route component.

## Verification

Local verification completed:

- `make ci.local.quick`

Remote verification:

- Current HEAD remote verification is pending until PR/merge readiness.
- Historical GitHub Actions `v1.1 quality gate` runs passed on earlier slice commits:
  `29192606652` on `bc4f270bc`, `29192995214` on `11c9be05f`, and `29193447131` on `cc958066b`.

## Rollback

Rollback is code-only:

1. Revert this slice commit.
2. Restore the prior inline type/helper definitions in `ContractFormPage.vue`.
3. No database, attachment, menu, or contract migration is required.
