## Required Next Actions

1. Promote only mapped and repeatable scenarios into the release gate.
2. Count a journey as strong only when fixed data and an executable gate are both present.
3. Store screenshot, browser log, server log, and request/response evidence on failure.
4. Keep PR smoke E2E small; run the full 12-journey matrix nightly and before release.
